          <h2>Web Access</h2>
          <p>The idea here is to have a web accessible version of Speak that can be used by guests and those outside of your organization to join into calls without having to download the full app. Of course, the web client will be seamlessly integrated with the desktop version of Speak.</p>

          <h2>Meeting Scheduling</h2>
          <p>There are two types of conversations in the business world, those that are ad-hoc and spontaneous (Speak is great at those!), and those calls that are scheduled ahead of time such as a weekly meeting. We plan to make this second type of conversation super easy on the Speak platform.</p>

          <h2>Open API</h2>
          <p>Behind the scenes we've been working on a RESTful API to access Speak's core functionality such as starting and stopping calls, getting who's online and other interesting bits. We'd love to open this up to developers and integrations before the end of the year.</p>

          <h2>Integrations</h2>
          <p>Using our open API to build deeper, easily installable integrations with your existing tools, such as Slack, Hipchat, Google Calendar and many more services.</p>
