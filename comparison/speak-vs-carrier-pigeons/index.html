      We know what you’re thinking - why use Speak when carrier pigeons already exist? We actually thought the same thing, but here are a few ways in which we think Speak does a better job of team communication.
    </p>
    <h2>Speak is faster</h2>
    <p>
      In our extensive tests we've found that the round-trip connection time of a carrier pigeon is far slower than using Speak. At a typical flight speed of 50mph, a healthy, well-trained pigeon might take several hours or even days to reach your co-worker with a message. Speak, on the other hand, connects in under half a second!

    <h2>Group calling is much simpler with Speak</h2>
    <p>
      With Speak you can create a group call by simply clicking on your co-workers faces in the app. You can also join an ongoing call just as easily. The same discussion using carrier pigeons is really quite difficult to achieve, since for every extra team member, another n pigeons must be fed, trained and housed - quite the unexpected expense!
    </p>

    <h2>Speak offers support when you need it</h2>
    
    <p>
      When things go wrong, it may take days or even weeks to find your pigeon... But if you ever need help with Speak, our tightknit team will answer your support request personally, and usually within the hour!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Oh, and did we mention there's no poop to clean up? The only dump that Speak takes are stacktraces (and we do the cleanup!). Once you give Speak a try, you’ll wonder how you ever did without it.
