        <em>Speak is a great alternative to GoToMeeting. Here's why you should consider making the switch:</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2>Speak is built for quick team communication</h2>
      <p>
         If you're looking for quick, daily team 1-on-1 and group communication, GoToMeeting just doesn't cut it. Speak, on the other hand, was built from the ground up to make daily communication a breeze for large and small teams alike.
       </p>
       <p>
         Our interface is designed to stay open all day, without getting in your way. This means that your team is always at your finger tips. Speak even knows if they've stepped away from their computer!
      </p>
    
      <h2>Speak is lighter</h2>
      <p>
        Speak was designed to be a pleasant and intuitive experience. It gives you all the features you need in order to stay in communication with your team, without all the bloat.

      <h2>We provide a much better customer experience</h2>
      <p>
        Each team member participates in customer support via a shared support inbox. And since our team spans multiple timzones, this means that most support requests are handled within an hour, and most within a matter of minutes!
      </p>
    
      <p>
        Being a smaller team also makes us more nimble. We make daily improvements to the product and are constantly squashing bugs and adding new features. We even have a <a href="/roadmap">public roadmap</a> so you can stay on top of what changes are coming.
