        <em>Speak is a great alternative to Sococo. Here's why you should consider making the switch:</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2>1) Speak is easier to use</h2>
      <p>
        With Speak, jumping into a conversation is as simple as clicking on your coworker's face. Once you're in a call, Speak stays out of your way so you're free to use your computer, but still know what's going on in your call.
      </p>
      
      <h2>2) Speak is much lighter</h2>

      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Sococo, Speak doesn't try take up your whole screen and bog you down with a bulky interface. Instead, it's integrated into your desktop so it's super light and works well with all of your other applications, especially your team chat tool!

      <h2>4) Speak plays well with your team chat tool</h2>
      <p>
        Speak works alongside your team chat tool to provide a seamless experience. And if you're using Slack, you can start a call just by typing "/speak name". Does it get much easier?
