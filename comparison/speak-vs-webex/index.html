    <h2>Speak is integrated into your desktop</h2>
    <p>
      Unlike Webex, Speak is built direclty into your desktop, but stays out of your way until you need it. This means that your team mates are always a click away. And with Speak's accurate presence detection, you always know who's available and ready to talk.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Speak is easier to use</h2>
    <p>
      With Speak, it's as simple as clicking on your team mate's face to start an instant call. No more fiddling with meeting links, or constantly asking "hey, are you there?". Speak makes daily team communication simpler than ever!
