        <em>Speak is a great alternative to Webex. Here's why you should consider making the switch:</em>
      </p>
      
      <h2>1) Speak is integrated into your desktop</h2>
      <p>
        <img src="/images/comparison/integrated.png" />
      </p>
      <p>
        Unlike Webex, Speak is built directly into your desktop. The optional people dock lives on your screen and gives you a window into your coworkers.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speak's presence detection is also extremely granular. When you see a green dot next to someone, this means they are actually sat at their computer and available. If you'd like to talk with them, just click their picture. It's that easy.
      </p>
    
      <h2>2) Speak is easier to use</h2>
      <p>
        Since Speak is built into your desktop, talking with your team doesn't get any easier. Simply click someone's face to start a call with them. If you'd like to add others to the call, click there face and they'll be brought in. No more fiddling with meeting links, or constantly asking "hey, are you there?". Speak is like a communication super power for your team.

            The UX is awesome. Really simple way of starting a video chat with a coworker. I love the dock and user presence based on activity.
