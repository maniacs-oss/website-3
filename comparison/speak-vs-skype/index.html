    <h2>Speak is built for teams</h2>
    <p>
       With Skype, it's commonplace to mix both your friends and coworkers together in one big list. 
       
       Does it really make sense to add someone as a contact just for a single meeting? Or to chat with your grandma in the same app you use or your daily standup? We don't think so. That's why we've built Speak specifically for teams and businesses.
    </p>
    <p>
      Your Speak team is made up of only the people you work with throughout the day. And there's no need to individually add contacts like Skype, since they're centrally managed by Speak.
    </p>
    
    <h2>Speak is faster</h2>
    <p>
      Speak let's you choose between normal phone calls or instant audio. For those times when you prefer to be quickly accessible, just flip on instant audio and your teammates will be able to talk to you without needing to accept. Think of it like an intercom or a walky talky!
    </p>
    
    <p>
      You can also dock Speak to the side of your screen. This means your coworkers are <em>literally</em> just a click away. After all, you have a dock for apps, why not for people too?

    <h2>Speak knows who is available</h2>
    <p>
      You know how it is in Skype. Everyone is always set to away so you never know who is really available! Unlike Skype, Speak accurately detects whether a teammate is at their computer, so you always know if they are available. No more calling, waiting, and hoping they pick up.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Speak also displays your team mates local times, which is particularly useful on remote / distributed teams, where it can be hard to keep track of who is in what timezone.
