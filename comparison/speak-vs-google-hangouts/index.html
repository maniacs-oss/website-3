        <em>Speak is a great alternative to Google Hangouts. Here's why you should consider making the switch:</em>
      </p>
         
      <h2>Speak is faster and easier</h2>
      <p>
        Unlike Hangouts, Speak is extremely simple and lightweight, so you don't have to waste time fiddling with the software. It contains everything you need to have a quick, productive call, and get on with your day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Starting a Hangout can also be quite complicated. Messing around with links and Google accounts can get pretty confusing! And the problems only grow worse the more people you add.
      </p>
      <p>
        Speak, on the other hand, is integrated directly into your desktop, and starting a call is as simple as clicking your coworker's face!

      <h2>Speak is built for teams</h2>
      <p>
        Hangouts is designed for scheduled meetings. It works best when you setup a time in the future and invite everyone over email in advance. Speak works well for scheduled meetings but also lets you have quick, ad-hoc discussions throughout the day.
      </p>
    
      <p>
        You can also see other meetings as they are happening and choose to join with one click. This is particularly great for tight knit, collaborative teams.
      </p>
    
      <h2>Speak offers support from real people</h2>
    
      <p>
        Since Hangouts is a free Google product, their support channel is limited to a basic help center and forum. With Speak, you can contact the team directly at any time. 
      </p>
