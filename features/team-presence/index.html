        <h2>Real Team Presence</h2>
        <p>
          Speak knows if a team member has stepped away from their computer. No more calling and hoping they pick up.

        <h2>Instant Audio or Call & Accept</h2>
        <p>
          When you want to be accessible, just enable “Instant Audio”. Think of it like opening the door to your office. For more privacy, close the door to your office by enabling "Call" mode.

        <h2>Work From Anywhere</h2>
        <p>
          As a remote team, it can be tough staying in contact and collaborating throughout the day. Speak makes this possible with "tap on the shoulder" style discussions and real team presence.
