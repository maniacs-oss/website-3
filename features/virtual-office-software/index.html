        <h2>A Modern Virtual Office</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike other tools, which rely on out-dated virtual metaphors and bulky interface, Speak is built in to your desktop and stays out of your way until you need it.

          Speak let's you know when your team mate is sat at their computer and available, just like in a real office! When you need to chat, just tap their face and you're talking in no time.
